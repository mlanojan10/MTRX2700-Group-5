  Instructions for user:

    To run all exercises, create a new project in STM32CubeIDE.
    Delete the .c files made in the Src folder.
    Copy all the files from the Src folder for each exercise in this repository, and insert it into the Src folder in your project.
    Open the assembly.s file in your project, and run it to start the code, or press debug to see each step of the code.
  
    Exercise 1:
      For a:
        Open the assembly.s file.
        Change the input string in line 9 to whatever you want.
        Set the mode to turn the string into uppercase or lowercase, by changinge line 17 with a 0 to convert to lower, or a 1 to convert to upper.

      For b:
        Open the assembly.s file.
        Change the input string in line 7 to whatever you want. This will be the string which will be tested if it is a palindrome or not.
        All special characters will be ignored, so "RAC$#$CaR" will be read as "RACCaR"
        Step through the code until it finishes. If R0 contains '0', it is not a palindrome, if it contains '1', it is a palindrome.
        
      For c:
        Open the assembly.s file.
        Change the input string in line 7 to whatever you want. This will be the string which will be encoded/decoded.
        Change the number in line 14 to change the value at which it shifts each letter.
        Step through the code until it reaches 'finished'.
        The final encoded/decoded string will be stored in R0. Convert it into ASCII to read the string.
